        bio: "ello delegates ,Welcome to DISEC at JBCN MS MUN where diplomacy is the real thing. I’m Ansh Shah, your Co-Director, and if there’s one thing I love more than Man City and the Indian Cricket team, it’s a debate so intense that it could cause an international crisis. This year, we wonder whether Private Military Organizations are a threat to mankind or not?Are they mercenaries to hire, or the heroes for our peace that we have? You decide! Just remember ,every organisation has its secrets, and I love it when delegates dig up classified dirt. I’m more than excited to help guide you through this deeply interesting topic and to unravel the mysteries behind Private military organisations.With 11 MUNs and this being my second time leading DISEC, I promise a committee full of chaos and hard-hitting diplomacy. In my free time, you can catch me watching a cricket highlight, or trying to perfect my blazer most of the time. And yes, I do love playing cricket! I know it feels pretty overwhelming to begin MUN. Trust me, I’ve been there. It’s about learning, engaging in debates, and finally, having some fun. So let loose a little from the barricades of your comfort zone and let’s make this a fantastic experience together. Looking forward to a great conference! Best regards, Ansh Shah",

        bio: "Hey Delegates, Welcome to DISEC, I’m honoured to be your Director for JBCN Middle School MUN, I’m here to ensure that this is gonna be fun for you all while also introducing you all to the concept of MUNs. Doing MUN speaks a lot about a person, showing that they’re capable enough to speak and discuss in front of others, present their viewpoints and most importantly have enough self confidence, don’t let this intimidate you, MUN can also be your stepping stone to discovering skills you never knew you had. I believe in strong speakers who can defend their perspectives and challenge others with strong arguments. There is nothing like a bad viewpoint, so the delegate should be apt at providing justifiable statements to support themselves. Nothing can match the ecstasy of delivering a powerful speech, or submitting that one radical communique to change the committee. If I had one piece of advice for delegates it would be this: Just have fun. I'm Bharatvir Saran, Directing DISEC for JBCN Middle School MUN 2025, I'm looking forward to seeing you delegates in person. Regards from the JBCN MUN Team",

I am an avid MUNNER and it has been my passion ever since my first MUN in grade 7. I strongly believe that  MUN is a fantastic platform to boost your confidence and public speaking skills. My advice for the first timers? Be confident, Confidence is always KEY. Although do not hesitate to approach me for any help, I'd be delighted to guide you through the intricacies of MUN procedure and speech making. Apart from MUN, I love to play tennis and would be pleased to discuss anything about Formula 1 outside of committee. In my free time I usually busy myself with a good book or watch some of my favorite sitcoms. I strongly believe that COPUOS will be the most exciting committee in this year's conference. I look forward to seeing blistering, on-the spot-speeches, controversial communiques, unique solutions and detailed paperwork.I eagerly look forward to meeting you. Let's make COPUOS the best committee in JBCN middle school MUN!! Regards Shaurya",

I can guarantee an action-packed, fast-paced and one-of-a-kind experience. I look forward to seeing controversial speeches, long POIs and logical solutions from the delegates present. For all the first timers, I encourage you to actively engage in debate and most importantly be confident. This conference is a good experience; You may arrive expecting nothing but leave as a best delegate. During my spare time I love to spectate and commentate on combat sports, listen to hip-hop, play video games, video edit and code. Within academics, I am fond of computer science, physics and economics.",

I'm Kasmia Mehra, Director of the Korean War Summit and I can't wait for this amazing committee to begin! :) I did my first MUN in 6th grade and haven't stopped since then. I truly feel it is the epitome of human society when people can come together despite difficult situations and find solutions for their problems together. This paired with the facts that mun allows you to explore different perspectives of the world with a fresh perspective just adds to my love for it. But MUN aside I am an avid sculpture artist who enjoys swimming in her free time. My favorite thing to do in the world is to see it, traveling. I think seeing, hearing, learning something new is the greatest feeling in the world. With that I hope to learn many new things from the Delegates who sign up for the K.W.S.",

From online to abroad conferences, MUN has become an integral part of my school life. Beyond MUN, I’m a huge Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Cobra Kai fanatic—so as you can probably tell, I absolutely love to Netflix and chill. I’m deeply passionate about global politics and debate, always ready for insightful discussions. Another major part of my life? Eating oats(while Netflix and chilling).I strongly believe they are one of life’s greatest pleasures. And if you disagree, I’m open to a brutal argument about that too—not joking. Also, not a threat. Perhaps my tenacious approach is kicking in! I can’t wait to see all of you in the Korean War Summit, alongside my fellow Executive Board and the organizing team, for what promises to be an exciting, intense, and meaningful experience!",
