    description: "Greetings Delegates, Welcome to DISEC, where we all attempt to bring peace through our resolutions while the plethora of mercenaries break it. This year's agenda? Private Military Organisations (PMOs), the freelancers of war who just can't seem to get enough money. Are they really the security experts as we know them or international chaos machines exploiting conflict zones? Some argue they 'assist' in conflicts (get paid to persecute people living through war), while others say they're just capitalism's version of war, why employ soldiers when you can hire some on a paid subscription plan? Groups like Wagner, Blackwater, and Aegis Defence have turned global conflict into their bread and butter, often operating outside the law and making governments and sovereignty look like side characters. So, delegates, the burning question is: are PMOs necessary evils, or just evils with a booming business model? Get ready to debate, expose deals, and maybe find a common solution. So are you delegates ready? Because we are!",

Doing MUN speaks a lot about a person, showing that they're capable enough to speak and discuss in front of others, present their viewpoints and most importantly have enough self confidence, don't let this intimidate you, MUN can also be your stepping stone to discovering skills you never knew you had. I believe in strong speakers who can defend their perspectives and challenge others with strong arguments. There is nothing like a bad viewpoint, so the delegate should be apt at providing justifiable statements to support themselves. Nothing can match the ecstasy of delivering a powerful speech, or submitting that one radical communique to change the committee. If I had one piece of advice for delegates it would be this: Just have fun. I'm Bharatvir Saran, Directing DISEC for JBCN Middle School MUN 2025, I'm looking forward to seeing you delegates in person. Regards from the JBCN MUN Team."

I'm Ansh Shah, your Co-Director, and if there's one thing I love more than Man City and the Indian Cricket team, it's a debate so intense that it could cause an international crisis. This year, we wonder whether Private Military Organizations are a threat to mankind or not?Are they mercenaries to hire, or the heroes for our peace that we have? You decide! Just remember ,every organisation has its secrets, and I love it when delegates dig up classified dirt. I'm more than excited to help guide you through this deeply interesting topic and to unravel the mysteries behind Private military organisations.With 11 MUNs and this being my second time leading DISEC, I promise a committee full of chaos and hard-hitting diplomacy. In my free time, you can catch me watching a cricket highlight, or trying to perfect my blazer most of the time. And yes, I do love playing cricket! I know it feels pretty overwhelming to begin MUN. Trust me, I've been there. It's about learning, engaging in debates, and finally, having some fun. So let loose a little from the barricades of your comfort zone and let's make this a fantastic experience together. Looking forward to a great conference! Best regards, Ansh Shah"

This committee serves as a vital platform for international cooperation in the exploration and utilization of outer space, ensuring that its benefits are accessible to all nations. Militarisation and weaponization in space is a new challenge presented to be tackled in a diplomatic manner considering the consequences and weight of every decision with constant twists and crises to maintain the pressure. This is a high-stakes scenario on the possible weaponization in space that must be looked at from each legal, social, economical, and logistical standpoint. The purpose of UNCOPUOS is to maintain outer space as a domain dedicated to peaceful purposes, promoting collaboration and addressing the challenges that arise from space activities. The potential deployment of weapons systems in outer space presents a grave and destabilizing threat to international peace and security. Such actions could escalate tensions between nations, transforming the vast expanse of space into a domain of conflict. Now it is up to you to navigate through this committee, resolving potential crises, launching satellites and preventing interstellar warfare to ensure peace and stability. Everything is on the line, the future of our world lies in your hands.",

Apart from MUN, I love to play tennis and would be pleased to discuss anything about Formula 1 outside of committee. In my free time I usually busy myself with a good book or watch some of my favorite sitcoms. I strongly believe that COPUOS will be the most exciting committee in this year's conference. I look forward to seeing blistering, on-the spot-speeches, controversial communiques, unique solutions and detailed paperwork.I eagerly look forward to meeting you.

This paired with the facts that mun allows you to explore different perspectives of the world with a fresh perspective just adds to my love for it. But MUN aside I am an avid sculpture artist who enjoys swimming in her free time. My favorite thing to do in the world is to see it, traveling. I think seeing, hearing, learning something new is the greatest feeling in the world. With that I hope to learn many new things from the Delegates who sign up for the K.W.S."

Eating oats(while Netflix and chilling).I strongly believe they are one of life's greatest pleasures. And if you disagree, I'm open to a brutal argument about that too—not joking. Also, not a threat. Perhaps my tenacious approach is kicking in!

The government faces mounting pressure as it navigates the complexities of national security, civil unrest, and political turmoil.

From my first MUN to now I have always believed that MUN isn't just about debating and finding solutions, it's about making strategies, negotiations and most importantly stepping out of your comfort zone. If there is one thing I love, it's a high-energy environment where every decision counts ,whether it's a film set or a debate. For those who are stepping into MUN for the very first time,I know the mix of nerves and excitement you all must be feeling as I felt the same during my first middle school mun in 7tn grade but trust me once you embrace the challenge there is nothing quite like it, MUN's are more than just awards it's about learning, understanding and finding your own voice in diplomacy. A bit about myself is that acting, debating, and dancing have always been my passions. From working in films like Hindi Medium, War to having my art featured in Hindustan Times I have explored the art of storytelling in many forms Stepping into an historical cabinet is like stepping into a political thriller, being a part of this cabinet means that your every decision will shape the direction in which the committee goes. Operation Blue star wasn't just a any ordinary operation it was one which shaped the Indian history. So get ready for an unforgettable journey filled with intense debates, unexpected and twist and last but not the least I hope you all have a great time. Regards, Dishita"
